# Myra Veltkamp - Business and Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Myra! I hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Data Analytics for Business from Seattle Pacific University, and a Bachelor of Art (B.A.) in Communication. I have worked in non-profit since 2012, higher education since 2015, and higher ed IT since 2021. 

I underwent a major career change that began in 2020 with a transition from event planning to information technology. In 2017 had the opportunity to help my team implement a new CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system, and I fell in love with information systems and teaching others how to best utilize new technology for their business. I embraced the implementation process and became a Power User, and later helmed my team's transition to virtual programming during the COVID-19 pandemic. I took on the opportunity to manage new remote business software and teach my team how to use it. In 2020 I began my master's in data analytics for business (focusing on predictive and exploratory analytics as well as information systems), and achieved my degree in 2022. From there, my knowledge grew and I became a resource on our campus for other departments to reach out to for support in remote business software. In 2021 I was hired by our IT department as a business systems analyst.
